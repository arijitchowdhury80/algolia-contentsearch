/**
 * judgeHandler — the SHARED `POST /api/judge` request logic, factored out so the
 * full lab webserver (webserver.ts) and the judge-only service (judgeService.ts)
 * run the SAME handler and can never drift onto different validation, provider
 * resolution, or wire shapes.
 *
 *   POST /api/judge  { question, panels:[{panelId,answer,sources,generatedFollowUp?}],
 *                      followUp?, isRefusalTest?, rounds? }
 *     -> LiveJudgeResult { rounds, panels:[LiveJudgeVerdict], deltas? }
 *
 * Two response modes (the client chooses via the Accept header):
 *   - Accept: text/event-stream → SSE:
 *       event: phase   data: { phase:"judging", panels, provider, model, rounds }
 *       event: panel   data: <LiveJudgeVerdict>     (one per panel, as it resolves)
 *       event: result  data: <LiveJudgeResult>      (the full result, last)
 *       event: error   data: { error }              (only on mid-stream failure)
 *   - otherwise → one JSON blob: <LiveJudgeResult> (back-compat).
 *
 * Each LiveJudgeVerdict carries the 4-dimension Confidence breakdown
 * (grounding / coverage / depth / relevance, each 1–10), the composite
 * (`synthesizedScore` / `composite`), the grounding gate (`gateTripped`), and the
 * flagged claims with per-claim `certainty`. The on-screen verdict is INDICATIVE
 * (fast model, 1 round); the batch `cli judge` remains authoritative.
 *
 * The handler is transport-thin: it owns parse → validate → resolve provider →
 * judge → respond, but takes the already-read request body string and the raw
 * node res, so callers wire CORS/auth/rate-limit themselves.
