/**
 * claimGate — claim-level multi-round grounding gate.
 *
 * Replaces the flicker-prone per-round confidence vote. The old gate tripped a
 * round whenever ANY verified violation fired, then took a supermajority over
 * rounds — so (a) heterogeneous one-off flags (a different imagined claim each
 * round) could gate, and (b) a borderline claim whose confidence wobbled around
 * the verified-confidence cutoff flipped the round trip on/off, landing the
 * fraction near the threshold and flipping run-to-run.
 *
 * This module decides the gate by CLAIM RECURRENCE: cluster the violations
 * across rounds by claim similarity, and trip only when the SAME claim is
 * flagged in a supermajority of rounds. A claim that appears once is treated as
 * noise; a real ungrounded claim recurs and gates stably regardless of
 * per-round confidence wobble. Pure: no I/O, deterministic.
